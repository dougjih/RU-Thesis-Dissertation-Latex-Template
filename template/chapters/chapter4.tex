\section{Experiments Setup}

In the experiments, six sets of admixtures are tested with many different clusterers. The six sets of admixtures are combinations of EPG sample types and whether high-pass filtering of EPGs is used. They are listed in \cref{table:Sets of simulated admixtures}.

In each set, there are the 11 admixture types described in \cref{table:Admixture types simulated}. Each admixture type consists of 1,000 trial runs of simulated admixtures that are generated by pseudo-random sampling of the available EPGs.

The clusterers to be tested are listed in \cref{table:Clusterer names}. The performance metrics of these clusterers on each set of admixtures will be collected. The top-performing clusterers will be identified, and cluster ensembles consisting of them will be formed, and in turn their performances will be measured.

Summary results are presented in this chapter. Additional results with breakdowns by individual admixture types are available in \cref{appendix:Additional Results}.

\subsection{Metrics}

The results are presented in terms of two types of metrics.

The first type consists of general-purpose clustering evaluation metrics including the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Adjusted Rand Index (ARI): the score range is $[-1, 1]$, with an expected score of approximately 0 for random clustering
  \item Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI): the score is upper bound at 1, with an expected score of approximately 0 for random clustering
  \item Homogeneity: the score range is $[0, 1]$
  \item Completeness: the score range is $[0, 1]$
  \item Fowlkes-Mallows index (FMI): the score range is $[0, 1]$
\end{itemize}

For all the above, a score of 1 indicates perfect labeling of clusters compared to the ground truth. For summary results, we will present the arithmetic means of the five metrics. In detailed charts, we also provide the scores with respect to individual metrics and admixture types.

The second type consists of binomial 95\% confidence intervals calculated using the Wilson score interval from fractions of perfect clustering results in terms of homogeneity and completeness. We will express these results in percentages. In detailed tables, we also provide the calculated bounds of the confidence intervals.

\section{Experiments Results---Mclust Baseline}

We first examine the performance of Mclust as the baseline, as it is the method that \cite{odonnell_clustering_2021} identifies as the most promising. More EPG data are now available than in the experiments in \cite{odonnell_clustering_2021}. In particular, 26 instead of 5 genotypes now are represented in the EPGs from saliva samples; 27 genotypes now are represented in the EPGs from blood samples; and 1 genotype now is represented in the EPGs from semen samples.

\subsection{Analysis}

Performance results from using Mclust with $L^{1}$ versus $L^{2}$ norms do not indicate a conclusive advantage in either in that neither has the best performance in all admixture types. Mclust shows noticeably better performance in clustering EPGs from blood samples than EPGs from saliva samples. It is particularly strong in clustering EPGs from blood samples that have been high-pass filtered.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Experiments Results---Individual Clusterers}

Having established a baseline using Mclust, we examine many other clusterers and their performances. As there are too many clusterers for which to present detailed performance figures and tables, we will instead use summary statistics to determine rankings, and from which we will determine the top-scoring clusterers (including the Mclust baseline clusterers) and present detailed performance figures and tables for the best few clusterers in \cref{appendix:Additional Results}.

\subsection{Analysis}

For EPGs from saliva samples only without high-pass filtering, many other clusterers overtake Mclust in overall performance. However, the top-scoring clusterers are different depending on the metrics. Affinity propagation and HDBSCAN clusterers score best in terms of overall clustering metrics, whereas mean-shift, BIRCH, and HDBSCAN clusterers score best in terms of perfect clustering percentages. 

For EPGs from saliva samples only with high-pass filtering, Mclust remains overall best in terms of overall clustering metrics. However, the various HDBSCAN clusterers overall perform better in terms of perfect clustering percentages.

For EPGs from blood samples only without high-pass filtering, Mclust remains overall best in terms of overall clustering metrics, with affinity propagation and BIRCH clusterers following behind. Mclust is clearly superior in terms of perfect clustering percentages.

For EPGs from blood samples only with high-pass filtering, the results are similar: Mclust remains overall best in terms of overall clustering metrics, with affinity propagation clusterers following behind. Mclust is again clearly superior in terms of perfect clustering percentages.

For EPGs from all samples without high-pass filtering, BIRCH, Mclust, and affinity propagation clusterers perform best in terms of overall clustering metrics. However, Mclust scores best in terms of perfect clustering percentages, with mean-shift and HDBSCAN clusterers following behind.

For EPGs from all samples with high-pass filtering, the results are similar, although Mclust's margin of advantage increases. Mclust, BIRCH, and affinity propagation clusterers place at the top in terms of overall clustering metrics. Mclust scores best in terms of perfect clustering percentages, with affinity propagation and HDBSCAN clusterers following behind.

\section{Experiments Results---Clusterer Ensembles}

With the performances of the individual clusterers measured, we next experiment with assembling cluster ensembles of a diverse group of top-scoring individual clusterers. \Cref{table:Clusterers selected to form cluster ensembles} shows the clusterers selected to form cluster ensembles. We will apply the cluster ensembles on the simulated admixtures, and we will compare their performances. Additional results are available in \cref{appendix:Additional Results}.

\subsection{Analysis}

Of the cluster ensembles tested, the ensemble solved by the Meta-CLustering Algorithm (MCLA) produces clearly superior results compared to all other cluster ensembles tested. The ``all'' solver produces for each label the label with the the highest average normalized mutual information score with labels from all the supported solvers \cite{sano_clusterensembles_nodate}. Its performance is similar to MCLA, a result that is explainable in that MCLA mostly produces the best results on the EPG data with the selected constituent clusterers.

\subsection{Analysis}

For EPGs from saliva samples only, none of the cluster ensembles perform in the top five, except for the MCLA ensemble, which places fifth in terms of mean metrics scores for high-pass filtered samples.

For EPGs from blood samples only, both without and with high-pass filtering, the MCLA ensembles place within the top five in terms of mean metrics scores although they trail the Mclust clusterers. Therefore, simply using Mclust for EPGs from blood samples appears the best choice.

For EPGs from all samples, the results are less clear. Mclust has the advantage in terms of percentages of perfect clustering both without and with high-pass filtering. In terms of mean metrics scores, Mclust also has the advantage with high-pass filtered data, although other clusterers, including the MCLA ensembles have the advantage with non-filtered data.

It appears that the cluster ensembles methods in general do not do well in terms of percentages of perfect clustering. We think this is a result of percentages of perfect clustering not being the measure by which the cluster ensembles methods compute the best consensus.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Summary}

Overall, Mclust demonstrates its strength over a variety of different sample types, especially blood samples. If the EPG data are high-pass filtered, and if only one clusterer can be used, then using Mclust appears to be a sound choice. If more than one clusterer can be used, then supplementing with the MCLA ensembles may be helpful to smooth out weak points of Mclust.

EPGs from saliva samples are the only cases in which Mclust fall short compared to other clustering methods, especially for data without high-pass filtering. There does not appear to be a single best alternative, as different clusterers perform best for different metrics. In real use, a cluster ensemble may be a sound choice for a consensus result, given that it is in general unknowable which clustering method will produce the best result, for the true answer is unknown.
