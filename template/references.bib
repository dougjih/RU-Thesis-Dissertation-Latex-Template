	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              In order to isolate an individual’s genotype from a sample of biological material, most laboratories use {PCR} and Capillary Electrophoresis ({CE}) to construct a genetic profile based on polymorphic loci known as Short Tandem Repeats ({STRs}). The resulting profile consists of {CE} signal which contains information about the length and number of {STR} units amplified. For samples collected from the environment, interpretation of the signal can be challenging given that information regarding the quality and quantity of the {DNA} is often limited. The signal can be further compounded by the presence of noise and {PCR} artifacts such as stutter which can mask or mimic biological alleles. Because manual interpretation methods cannot comprehensively account for such nuances, it would be valuable to develop a signal model that can effectively characterize the various components of {STR} signal independent of a priori knowledge of the quantity or quality of {DNA}.
            
            
              Results
              
                First, we seek to mathematically characterize the quality of the profile by measuring changes in the signal with respect to amplicon size. Next, we examine the noise, allele, and stutter components of the signal and develop distinct models for each. Using cross-validation and model selection, we identify a model that can be effectively utilized for downstream interpretation. Finally, we show an implementation of the model in {NOCIt}, a software system that calculates the
                a posteriori
                probability distribution on the number of contributors.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              The model was selected using a large, diverse set of {DNA} samples obtained from 144 different laboratory conditions; with {DNA} amounts ranging from a single copy of {DNA} to hundreds of copies, and the quality of the profiles ranging from pristine to highly degraded. Implemented in {NOCIt}, the model enables a probabilisitc approach to estimating the number of contributors to complex, environmental samples.},

It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only 'traditional' clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

In this technical correspondence, we want to point out some inaccuracies in the way {DBSCAN} was represented, and why the criticism should have been directed at the assumption about the performance of spatial index structures such as R-trees and not at an algorithm that can use such indexes. We will also discuss the relationship of {DBSCAN} performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate {DBSCAN} parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new {SIGMOD} 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the {DBSCAN} parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original {DBSCAN} algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.},

            Clustering is central to many data-driven bioinformatics research and serves a powerful computational method. In particular, clustering helps at analyzing unstructured and high-dimensional data in the form of sequences, expressions, texts and images. Further, clustering is used to gain insights into biological processes in the genomics level, e.g. clustering of gene expressions provides insights on the natural structure inherent in the data, understanding gene functions, cellular processes, subtypes of cells and understanding gene regulations. Subsequently, clustering approaches, including hierarchical, centroid-based, distribution-based, density-based and self-organizing maps, have long been studied and used in classical machine learning settings. In contrast, deep learning ({DL})-based representation and feature learning for clustering have not been reviewed and employed extensively. Since the quality of clustering is not only dependent on the distribution of data points but also on the learned representation, deep neural networks can be effective means to transform mappings from a high-dimensional data space into a lower-dimensional feature space, leading to improved clustering results. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art {DL}-based approaches for cluster analysis that are based on representation learning, which we hope to be useful, particularly for bioinformatics research. Further, we explore in detail the training procedures of {DL}-based clustering algorithms, point out different clustering quality metrics and evaluate several {DL}-based approaches on three bioinformatics use cases, including bioimaging, cancer genomics and biomedical text mining. We believe this review and the evaluation results will provide valuable insights and serve a starting point for researchers wanting to apply {DL}-based unsupervised methods to solve emerging bioinformatics research problems.},

	abstract = {Cells can be linked to the person who produced them by examining the information contained within their {DNA}. The challenge that a forensic analyst faces is to question whether a collection of cells obtained from a crime scene supports the hypothesis that a person of interest was present. The primary challenge is that cell samples collected at crime scenes typically contain material from an unknown number of genetic sources in an unknown mixture ratio. The standard genetic measurement protocol used in crime labs produces a single, combined signal for the entire collection of cells. If there are a small number of contributors, cells are in good condition, and the mixture ratio is not overly imbalanced, armed with this measurement, informative inference is possible for a trier of fact. If, however, the sample is complex, containing more than three genetic sources, or if the mixture ratio is highly imbalanced, or if genetic information within cells is degraded, the ability to confidently extract meaning from the measured signal is impaired. In high profile work published in the late 1990s it was demonstrated that genotype information could be extracted from individual cells. When used in a forensics context, single-cell methods offer a potential solution to the complex mixture problem by providing genetic information per-cell rather than solely for the whole collection. Advances in those mea- surement methods mean that single cell technologies may soon be practicable in crime labs. Significant challenges on the interpretation of the signals that result, however, re- main. Instead of having a single high dimensional signal to assess, the trier of fact now has one for each cell. In the present thesis we take one step towards enabling the res- olution of the complex mixture problem by proposing and assessing two methodologies that would facilitate the downstream analysis of genetic signal from a collection of single cells. Our goal is to query whether it is possible to use unsupervised machine learning to accurately and efficiently gather single cell signals into groups by genotype. If possible, it would greatly reduce the computational complexity of the evaluation of evidence and improve its accuracy. The results in this thesis suggest that this approach is viable and advances the potential of this societally important technology.},

	abstract = {Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index ({ARI}) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information ({AMI}) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic ({IT}) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon {IT} measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized {IT} measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized {IT} measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized {IT} measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using {ARI} and {AMI} as external validation indices: {ARI} should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; {AMI} should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters.},

We compare V-measure to a number of popular cluster evaluation measures and demonstrate that it satisfies several desirable properties of clustering solutions, using simulated clustering results.

Such “exemplars” can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called “affinity propagation,” which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

	abstract = {Finding useful patterns in large datasets has attracted considerable interest recently, and one of the most widely studied problems in this area is the identification of
              clusters,
              or densely populated regions, in a multi-dimensional dataset. Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named
              {BIRCH}
              (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases.
              {BIRCH}
              incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints).
              {BIRCH}
              can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans.
              {BIRCH}
              is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate
